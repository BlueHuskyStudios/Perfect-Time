# Perfect Time
A library for keeping track of time perfectly. That is, you can use this to precisely pinpoint an insanely small moment in time.

## Basic premises:
- **Always use strings to store time**, to guarantee no loss in precision. This makes it slightly less performant on low-speed systems like digital watches and flip phones, but all modern systems should handle this fine.
- **Only store in GMT** (offset +00.00).
- **Use [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)** to represent time. That is, treat `0` as the very beginning of 1970, and each number represents the linear progression of time in seconds.
	- Except: **[Leap Seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second) are [smeared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second#Workarounds_for_leap_second_issues) across a whole day.** Although this may cause it to be offset by Â½ second at noon, it also guarantees that a given timestamp always references the same exact point in time.
	- **Store it in base 10.** That is, using only the digits (U+0030 to U+0039 `0123456789`), an optional dash (U+002D `-`) to represent dates prior to 1970, and a singular, mandatory full stop for the radix point (U+002E `.`). Other characters are not to be used. A Perfect Time string must match the regex `/-[0-9]+\.[0-9]{18}/`.
	- **Use 18 fractional digits** to represent parts of a second as small as an attosecond. For example, `1456020377.0123456789112345678`. This is precise enough to [track light traveling across atoms](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=distance+light+travels+in+1+attosecond).
		- When the data comes from systems that cannot track time that precisely, **fill untrackable digits with zeroes.** For instance, if a system can only track time as precise as milliseconds: `1456021196.012000000000000000`.
